            <p>Often my ideas for code projects come from using other products and thinking, “I should be able to do this thing” and then realizing, “Hey wait — I think I know enough to make it so I can do this thing!” at which point, of course, I <em>have</em> to do it.</p>

<p>This recent project was no exception. When the new RSpec Ironboard gem was introduced, allowing us to test our local builds and get credit for them on Ironboard, I thought it was pretty awesome. But we had already done so many labs, and I wanted to try it on them, but it seemed like that would mean cding into every lab directory and running the gem manually, which sucks. It occurred to me that I might have the skills to automate this process, so I had to try it.</p>

<p>The result is <a href="https://github.com/molgin/ironboard-batch-tester">Ironboard Batch Tester</a>, a simple script that, given a path to a labs folder and a GitHub username, tests all the available labs and uploads them to Ironboard.</p>

<p>Here’s some of the stuff I learned along the way.</p>

<h4 id="checkingouttherspecironboardcode">Checking out the RSpec Ironboard code</h4>

<p>I could have just automated the process of changing directories and executing the <code>ironboard</code> bash command, but that didn’t seem like the right plan. If the Ironboard gem was written in Ruby and I was writing in Ruby I should just be able to look inside the gem and do whatever it does when that command is run.</p>

<p>Turns out checking out the source code of any Ruby gem is really easy. The command <code>gem unpack rspec-ironboard</code> puts the code in a folder in your working directory where you can rifle through it to your heart’s content. I immediately opened the <code>bin/ironboard</code> file to find out what happens when I run that <code>ironboard</code> command. Here it is:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">#!/usr/bin/env ruby

SERVICE_URL = 'http://ironbroker.flatironschool.com'  
SERVICE_ENDPOINT = '/e/flatiron_rspec/build/ironboard'  
require 'rspec/ironboard'

username = RSpec::Ironboard::UsernameParser.get_username  
user_id = RSpec::Ironboard::UserIdParser.get_user_id  
repo = RSpec::Ironboard::RepoParser.get_repo  
runner = RSpec::Ironboard::Runner.new(username, user_id, repo, ARGV)  
runner.run
</code></pre>

<p>Cool! So basically it gets the user’s github username, user_id, and repo name, and then uses that info (along with <code>ARGV</code> which I know from my brief forays into C contains any command line arguments) to initialize a new <code>Runner</code> object, which it then runs by calling <code>#run</code>.</p>

<p>I checked out how these methods worked as well. To get the username, it just asks the user for their username. It gets the user ID from Github based on the username. It gets the repo name using this code:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">class RepoParser  
      def self.get_repo
        begin
          repo = Git.open(FileUtils.pwd)
        rescue
          puts "Not a valid Git repository"
          die
        end

        url = repo.remote.url

        repo_name = url.match(/(?:https:\/\/|git@).*\/(.+)(?:\.git)/)[1]
      end

      def self.die
        exit
      end
    end
</code></pre>

<p>This creates a <code>Git</code> object based on the current diretory, full of info about the repository, as long as it is one. It gets the remote URL from that and then applies a regex to extract just the repo name from that. This is kinda cool because it could just get the repo name from the directory name, since they’ll be the same by default when cloning, but this works even if the user has changed the name of the directory.</p>

<p>Then it creates and runs the <code>Runner</code> object, which is the meat of the gem. It's kind of long, and <em>mostly</em> its inner workings didn’t affect my project, so I won’t reproduce it here, but I encourage you to <code>gem unpack rspec-ironboard</code> and check it out for yourself.</p>

<h4 id="objectorientedprogrammingreallyisbetter">Object-oriented programming really is better</h4>

<p>When I started, I just wanted to see if I could make the thing work really quick so I just threw together a rather lazy procedural solution. It was pretty much just one long method, as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">def test_all(path, skipped_labs, username, user_id, skip_successful_labs_on_rerun)  
  Dir.chdir path do
    puts Dir.pwd
    f = File.open('.passing_labs', 'a+')
    passing_labs = f.each_line.with_object([]) { |line, ary| ary.push line.strip }
    f.close
    labs = Dir.glob("**/*006/").sort_by{ |f| File.ctime(f) }
    skipped_labs += passing_labs if skip_successful_labs_on_rerun
    skipped_labs.each do |skipped_lab|
      labs.reject! { |lab| lab.include? skipped_lab }
    end
    puts "All the non-skipped labs have already been tested and passed!" if labs.empty?
    labs.each do |lab|
      Dir.chdir lab do
        lab_name = lab.split("/").find { |str| str.include? "-ruby-006" }
        nice_lab_name = lab_name.sub("-ruby-006","").split("-").map(&amp;:capitalize).join(" ")
        puts "\nChecking #{nice_lab_name}...\n\n".magenta
        repo = RSpec::Ironboard::RepoParser.get_repo
        runner = RSpec::Ironboard::Runner.new(username, user_id, repo, [])
        runner.run
        if runner.formatted_results[:failure_count] == 0
          File.open("#{path}/.passing_labs", 'a') do |f|
            f.puts lab_name
          end
        end
      end
    end
  end
end  
</code></pre>

<p>It’s not very pleasant to look at and it wouldn’t be much fun to change. It worked, but I knew I could do better. So I refactored it into an object-oriented version:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">class IronboardTester  
  attr_reader :path, :username
  attr_accessor :skipped_labs, :skip_successful_labs_on_rerun, :passing_labs, :labs

  def initialize(path, username, skipped_labs, skip_successful_labs_on_rerun)
    @path = path
    @username = username
    @skipped_labs = skipped_labs
    @skip_successful_labs_on_rerun = skip_successful_labs_on_rerun
    @passing_labs = read_or_create_log
    @labs = get_labs
  end

  def user_id
    @user_id ||= get_user_id
  end

  def get_user_id
    RSpec::Ironboard::UserIdParser.get_user_id
  end

  def repo
    RSpec::Ironboard::RepoParser.get_repo
  end

  def new_runner(lab)
    RSpec::Ironboard::Runner.new(username, user_id, repo, [])
  end

  def test(lab)
    Dir.chdir "#{lab}" do
      runner = new_runner(lab)
      runner.run
      if runner.formatted_results[:failure_count] == 0
        log(lab)
      end
    end
  end

  def log(lab)
    File.open("#{path}/.passing_labs", 'a') do |f|
      f.puts lab_name(lab)
    end
  end

  def read_or_create_log
    f = File.open("#{path}/.passing_labs", 'a+')
      passing_labs = f.each_line.with_object([]) { |line, ary| ary.push line.strip }
    f.close
    passing_labs
  end

  def get_labs
    Dir.glob("#{path}/**/*006/").sort_by{ |f| File.ctime(f) }
  end

  def skip_passing_labs
    self.skipped_labs = skipped_labs | passing_labs
  end

  def lab_name(lab)
    lab.split("/").find { |str| str.include? "-ruby-006" }.gsub("_", "-")
  end

  def nice_lab_name(lab)
    lab_name(lab).sub("-ruby-006","").split("-").map(&amp;:capitalize).join(" ")
  end

  def announce(lab)
    puts "\nChecking #{nice_lab_name(lab)}...\n".magenta
  end

  def test_all
    labs.each do |lab|
      announce(lab)
      test(lab)
    end
  end

  def run
    self.passing_labs = read_or_create_log
    skip_passing_labs if skip_successful_labs_on_rerun
    puts "All the non-skipped labs have already been tested and passed!".magenta if labs.empty?
    test_all
  end

end

<p>Obviously it’s longer, but I think it‘s much nicer. I’ve been reading Sandi Metz’s <a href="http://www.poodr.com/"><em>Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby</em></a> and I attempted to follow her recommendations of single responsibility for methods and isolation of dependencies. Now if I want to change something (which I have) it’s a lot easier to see what’s what.</p>

<p>I’m sure there are many potentially better ways I could have organized this, but still I was pretty happy with it.</p>

<h4 id="thinkingaboutotherfeatures">Thinking about other features</h4>

<p>Originally I just wanted my program to take in a path to the folder where the user keeps their labs and run the <code>Runner</code> in each folder. But as I worked on it and talked to other people, I realized it needed some adjustments.</p>

<h6 id="abilitytoparsenestedfoldersoflabs">Ability to parse nested folders of labs</h6>

<p>I just keep all my labs in one big folder, but Sam told me he keeps his organized in subfolders by week and day. My original implementation couldn’t handle this, since it just read the name of every top-level folder after cding into the main folder:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">labs = Dir['*']  
</code></pre>

<p>To fix this I figured out that I could use <code>Dir.glob</code> to recursively look through folders, stopping at folders that end in "006" as I expect lab folders to.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby ">Dir.glob("#{path}/**/*006/")  
</code></pre>

<p>This could probably be done better, because after all, what if the user has changed the folder names? Maybe I could attempt to check whether each folder is a valid Git repository. But still, this was a significant improvement.</p>

<h6 id="makingitprettier">Making it prettier</h6>

<p>When my tester runs all your local labs at once, it obviously spits out a ton of output. I thought it would be nicer and easier to understand if I could have it announce each lab before testing it, ideally in a color that would stand out.</p>

<p>And of course, there’s a gem for that! <a href="https://github.com/fazibear/colorize">Colorize</a> adds methods that you can call on your strings so that they’ll print in colors:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">require 'colorize'  
...
def announce(lab)  
  puts "\nChecking #{nice_lab_name(lab)}...\n".magenta
end  
</code></pre>

<h6 id="skippinglabsthathavealreadypassed">Skipping labs that have already passed</h6>

<p>When testing I had to run my program a lot, and I also realized that if any labs threw an error, you'd have to run it again. I had already designed a way to add labs to a list and skip them, but what about the labs that have already been tested and passed? There’s unlikely to be a need to re-test them.</p>

<p>So I added a way for my program to keep track of which labs have already passed.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">def test(lab)  
  Dir.chdir "#{lab}" do
    runner = new_runner(lab)
    runner.run
    if runner.formatted_results[:failure_count] == 0
      log(lab)
    end
  end
end

def log(lab)  
  File.open("#{path}/.passing_labs", 'a') do |f|
    f.puts lab_name(lab)
  end
end  
</code></pre>

<p>From looking at the gem source, I found out that the runner object stores the results of each lab’s tests as a hash in an instance variable, <code>formatted_results</code>. The key <code>:failure_count</code> is, well, the failure count. If it’s zero, my program opens a hidden file, <code>.passing_labs</code>, in the main labs directory, and adds that lab’s name to it.</p>

<p>Then each time the program it reads the file and converts its contents into an array with the method <code>read_or_create_log</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">def read_or_create_log  
  f = File.open("#{path}/.passing_labs", 'a+')
    passing_labs = f.each_line.with_object([]) { |line, ary| ary.push line.strip }
  f.close
  passing_labs
end  
</code></pre>

<p>Then it‘s easy for the program to skip the labs in that list, the same way it skips the other skipped labs.</p>

<h4 id="otherfeaturestopossiblyadd">Other features to possibly add</h4>

<p>There are definitely a few ways this program could be improved. A couple that come to mind are...</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Error handling</strong> - It’s fairly likely that at least one of the hundred-plus labs the program tests will throw an error, in which case currently the program terminates, forcing the user to either fix that lab or manually add its name to the list of skipped labs and re-run the program. It would be nice if, instead, it could print a message explaining the error and ask the user if they’d like to skip the lab and proceed, possibly even storing that information so it will be skipped in the future as well.</li>
<li><strong>Improved user-friendliness</strong> - Currently to use the program, you have to open it up and edit it to assign your labs folder path and your GitHub username to variables. It might be nice if instead it would ask you for this info when you run it, again possibly storing this info for future use and providing an interface for altering other info, like the skipped labs list, as well.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>In the end, I’m really glad I did this project even if I’m the only one to use it. It was really fun and great practice and I learned a ton. I also had some illuminating debugging experiences that I‘ll save for another day.</p>

<p>So far, I’m happy with my compulsion to try to solve every possibly solvable problem I encounter. Even if it’s trivial, it’s worth it for what I learn in the process.</p>
